I'm a Data Scientist at [GovTech](tech.gov.sg) where I build Machine Learning products and tools for public good.

Before this, I worked at the Ministry of Health where I worked on healthcare financing policy, and data analytics for COVID-19 and population health. 

I graduated from LSE and MIT with a BSc in Economics and Masters of Business Analytics respectively.

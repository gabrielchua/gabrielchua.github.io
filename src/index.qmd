I'm Data Scientist at [GovTech](https://tech.gov.sg/), where my current work centers on MLOps and prototyping of LLM solutions for labor market and Responsible AI use-cases. Additionally, I co-organise AI Wednesdays, a weekly gathering of AI practitioners, and co-organise community hackathons and demo sessions.

Before this role, I was a policy analyst at the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.sg/), where I focused on financing policies and analytics for COVID-19.

I hold a BSc in Economics from LSE and a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics from MIT.

In my free time, I practice pilates, exploring the outdoors, and enjoy a good beer.

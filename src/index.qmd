I'm a Data Scientist at [GovTech](https://tech.gov.sg/), where my current work focuses on (1) MLOps, (2) prototyping LLM solutions, and (3) Responsible AI. Additionally, I co-organize AI Wednesdays, a weekly gathering of AI practitioners, as well as other community hackathons and demo sessions.

Before this role, I was a policy analyst at the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.sg/), where I focused on financing policies and analytics for COVID-19.

I hold a BSc in Economics from LSE and a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics from MIT.

In my free time, I practice pilates, explore the outdoors, and enjoy a good beer.

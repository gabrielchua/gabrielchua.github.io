I am a Data Scientist at [GovTech](https://tech.gov.sg) where my current work focuses on MLOps and prototyping LLM applications for labour market applications.

Previously, I served as a policy analyst at the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.sg/) reviewing primary care financing policies (e.g. subsidies, capitation funding for population health) and data analytics for COVID-19. My proudest achievements include contributing to the data pipelines for the nightly COVID-19 press releases, and co-authoring a [White Paper](https://file.go.gov.sg/healthiersg-whitepaper-pdf.pdf) that was debated in Parliament.

I gravitate towards new ideas and am curious about the intersection of different disciplines. With a background in the social sciences, my career evolved towards applied machine learning. I hold a BSc in Economics from LSE and a Master's in Business Analytics from MIT. 

Outside of work, I enjoy pilates, a good beer, and hiking.

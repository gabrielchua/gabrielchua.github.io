    "text": "I am a Data Scientist at GovTech, where my team builds data and ML products for public good. My current work focuses on MLOps and prototyping LLM applications for labour market applications.\nPreviously, I served as a policy analyst at the Ministry of Health, focusing on healthcare financing policy (e.g.Â subsidies, capitation funding), population health, and data analytics for COVID-19. My proudest achievements include contributing to the data pipelines for the nightly COVID-19 press releases, and co-authoring a White Paper that was debated in Parliament.\nWith a background in social science, my career evolved towards machine learning. I hold a BSc in Economics from LSE and a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics from MIT. I gravitate towards new ideas and am curious about the intersection of different disciplines.\nOutside of work, I enjoy pilates, a good beer, and soaking in nature."
